# assignment-3-
This assignment creates a binary search tree from a csv file. The binary search tree has a method that organizes movie titles into alphabetical order in segments. A linked list was used to organize the binary search tree. Multiple arrays were used to edit the characters in each title and year (in order to make the find and search like operations easier). The subset function was modified with the intensions being that less code would be written this way. By taking the root as a parameter the root node would not have to be abstracted and the writing code to switch nodes would not have to be written (as much).
